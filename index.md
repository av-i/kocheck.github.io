    Iâ€™m Kyle Kochanek, a product designer
  </h1>  
  <h1>
    Just what you need for that app you always wanted...</h1>
  <p>
    I design with intuition informed by research, data and a strong game plan <span>(end goal of the product)</span>. Currently I work at Momentum as a Senior Product Designer. Previously I have worked with a relief non-profit raising money to provide aid around the world. I am always looking to work with non-profits to help make the world a little brighter.

  <p>
    In my spare time I enjoy cycling, sci fi movies, and reading. Mostly reading or listening to podcasts.

    I am available for work. Send me direct message on twitter or email me.
